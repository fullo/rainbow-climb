# Rainbow Climb

A generative vertical platformer for Android inspired by *Rainbow Islands* (Taito, 1987).

Climb infinitely through procedurally generated levels, shoot rainbows to create platforms, and survive an ever-accelerating auto-scrolling camera. Features 8 unique biomes with procedurally generated electronic music.

## Features

- **Infinite procedural levels** — chunk-based generation ensures every run is unique
- **Rainbow mechanic** — shoot rainbow arcs that become temporary platforms and damage enemies
- **8 biomes** — Sky Garden, Cloud Kingdom, Neon City, Crystal Cave, Fire Ruins, Candy Land, Space Station, Haunted Forest
- **Procedural electronic music** — real-time synthesized chiptune/techno that adapts to gameplay
- **6 enemy types** — Walker, Flyer, Hopper, Shooter, Bomber, Chaser
- **5 power-ups** — Rainbow Boost, Double Jump, Shield, Slow Time, Magnet
- **Difficulty scaling** — +0.2% per level (compounding), gentle but relentless
- **Fully offline** — no internet required
- **Seed sharing** — same seed = same level layout
